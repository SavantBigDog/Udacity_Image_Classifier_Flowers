# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

The project has two parts. The first was coded using a Jupyter Notebook and can be run after launching Jupyter from the command line. The second part breaks the code in the Jupyter notebook into two seperate Python programs; train.py and predict.py. These can be run from the command line in the following order:

1. Train.py
2. Predicts.py

In both, the training section will train the AI and save a checkpoint. The predict section loads a checkpoint and predicts the probability of an image.
